### Getting Started

The [getting started document area](/docs/start/installation) describes the installation and structure of the CANopen stack project. The usage is presented by describing the steps to a first CANopen device (a hypothetic CANopen clock).

### CANopen Usage

The [CANopen usage document area](/docs/usecase/architecture) describes the architecture and common use cases for a CANopen stack. 

### API Functions

The [API functions document area](/docs/api/node/) contains all API functions for the application software. These functions allows the application to manipulate the object dictionary and control the behavior of the communication.

### Hardware Connection

The [hardware connection document area](/docs/hardware/interface/) describes the hardware-dependent part of the API functions. *Note: the CAN drivers itself are not part of this repository*
