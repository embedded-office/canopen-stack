# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and starting with version 4.1.0 this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [unreleased]

### Change

- Replace sizeof() operators with the constant value
- Add error checking in COTPdoMapWrite [ezrec](https://github.com/ezrec)

## [4.4.0] - 2022-08-21

### Add

- Add unit tests for all object type functions
- Add CMake presets for simplified usage of CMake in CI/CD
 
### Changed

- Separate all object type functions into separate files
- Adjust repository structure to recommendations in "Professional CMake - A Practical Guide"
- Move website to separate repository

### Attention: This release introduces a breaking change:

Handle basic type implementations with separate type function files and in consequence enlarge the object entry flags from `CO_OBJ_DNPRW` to `CO_OBJ_DNAPRW`. This change required adjustments in existing object dictionary definitions:

```c
old:
  {CO_KEY(0x1001, 0, CO_UNSIGNED8 |CO_OBJ____R_), 0, (CO_DATA)(&Obj1001_00_08)},

new:
  {CO_KEY(0x1001, 0, CO_OBJ_____R_), CO_TUNSIGNED8, (CO_DATA)(&Obj1001_00_08)},
    add an underscore or A ---^         ^
    ensure type starts with CO_T -------'
```
